                <b>Welcome to the Alumni Association of Bksp !</b><br>
                We're here to connect Bksp alumni or ex-students from all around Bangladesh and keep you informed 
                about the news, & events held in and around you; our alumni live all over the country and are
                involved in all sorts of professions and businesses, but the one thing they all have in common is 
                the unique 'Bksp experience.'
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>In May of 2019, a newly-formed BKSP Alumni consultative team</b> was established as an extension of 
                the Alumni Association of BKSP, spreading the word to other alumni about the steps and initiatives 
                in an effort to revitalize AAB throughout the year.  
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the initiatives, Alumni Association of Bksp has partnered with individuals and 
                consulting groups to create an alumni <b>database /or directory</b>. We are simply trying to update our 
                database with current information on our alumni.   
            </p>
            <p>

                Our largest and most active alumni groups are based in Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet 
                and we have strong presence in the UK and other North American cities. We are planning to host events 
                to connect with our fellow school friends to help strengthen our relations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After all, we have over 1500 alumni throughout the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also recently formed a Consultative Constitutional Committee, drawing from our dedicated
                and established alumni base. Our humble and prudent individuals in our leadership has already 
                developed a Framework of Internal Governance (FIG) or for the matter some say AAB Constitution.

            <p>
                If you would like to do more, we would love to have you join our consultative team for intelligence and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are fortunate to have found a great group of ex-students - representing academic years of
                1986/87 through 2018/19, and a school of spirited volunteers to help mentor and guide the 
                Alumni Association of BKSP. 
            </p>
            <p>We need you to make Bksp-Alumni as good as it possibly can get!</p>
            <p>We look forward to meeting you!</p><br>
