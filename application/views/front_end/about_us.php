                Sport has a very prominent role in modern society. It is important to an individual, a group, 
                a nation- indeed the world. Throughout the world sport has a popular appeal among people of all ages 
                and both sexes. It is being considered as an important criterion for the enhancement of prestige and 
                image of any nation. Huge financial investment, scientific research work and extensive media coverage 
                of sports allover indicate its significance in the modern world. Over the years, all the nations of the
                world have been inspired by the above values and have entered into this sphere in a big way, thus making
                attainment of high sports standards even more difficult at the international level. In our country, the
                urge to promote sports, both in the Government and the private sectors, was always there. The 
                prevailing socio-economic condition during the early years denied the scope to provide adequate 
                infrastructure facilities and appropriate coaching facilities, which is indispensable for promotion
                and development of a sports in any country. In order to meet the above demand, the concept of Sports
                Institute originated to take the responsibility of identifying and nurturing talented sportspersons
                and producing efficient coaches and other technical experts.

                To achieve this goal, the Government of Bangladesh made a plan in 1974 to establish the Bangladesh 
                Institute of Sports, as a project, under the National Sports Council. As a result, the Bangladesh
                Institute of Sports was established in 1976, as a Government Department. Subsequently, in 1983, the name 
                of Bangladesh Institute of Sports was changed to Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan (BKSP) and as such 
                became an autonomous statutory organization. The regular coaching and academic programmes commenced at 
                the Institute from 14th April, 1986. Since then BKSP is serving with utmost sincerity to accomplish the 
                dream of producing high caliber sportspersons who can earn laurels for the country and establish the 
                reputation of Bangladesh as a sports loving nation in the world.
